*History*

Cloud computing was proposed in 1961 by McCarthy
In 2002, Amazon created AWS
Amazon launched Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) in 2006

*Capacity Planning*

Process of determining and fulfilling future demands of an ogranizations IT's resources, products, and services.

*Lead Strategy* 

Adding capacity to an IT resource in anticipation of demand

*Lag Strategy*

Adding capacity when the IT resources reaches its full capacity

*Match Strategy*

Adding IT resource capacity in small increments, as demand increases

*Cloud*

A distinct IT environment that is designed for the purpose remotely provisioning scalable and measured IT resources
Typically privately owned and offers access to IT resources that is metered.

*IT Resource*

Physical or virtual IT-related artifact that can be either software based, such as a virtual server or a custom software program, or hardware-based, such as a physical server or a network device.

*Scaling*

 Ability of the IT resource to handle increased or decreased usage demands.
 
 *Horizontal Scaling* 
 
 Scaling out and scaling in
 Referred to as scaling out and the horizontal releasing of resources is referred to as scaling in.
 Common form of scaling
 Less expensive
 
 *Vertical Scaling* 
 
 Scaling up - replacing of an IT resource with another that has a higher capacity
 Scaling down - replacing an IT resource with another that has a lower capacity
 Costly

 *Cloud Service*

 Any IT resource that is made remotely accessible via a cloud.

 *Cloud Service Consumer*

Temporary runtime role assumed by a software program when it accesses a cloud service.
May be a software program or a hardware device.

*Asproportional Cost*

A cloud's Measured Usage characteristic represents a feature-set that allows measured operational expenditures to replace anticipated capital expenditures.

*Service Level Agreements (SLAS)*

The leasing of cloud-based services and IT resources.

*Portability*

A measure used to determine the impact of moving cloud consumer IT resources and data between clouds

*Six Properties of Cloud Computing by Google*

1. Cloud computing is user-centric
2. Cloud computing is task-centric
3. Cloud computing is powerful
4. Cloud computing is accessible
5. Cloud computing is intelligent
6. Cloud computing is programmable

*Six Properties of Cloud Computing by Google*

1. Trade captial expense for variable expense
2. Benefit from massive economies of scale
3. Stop guessing capacity
4. Increase speed and agility
5. Stop spending money on running and maintaining data centers
6. Go global in minutes

*Infrastructure as a Service*

Instant computing infrastructure, provisioned and managed over the Internet.
Quickly scale up and down with demand, and pay only for what you use.
Highest level of flexibility and management control over your IT resources.

*High-perfomance computer*

Helps solve complex problems involving millions of variables or calculations.

*Platform as a Service*

Development and deployment environment in the cloud, that enable you to deliver everything from simple cloud-based apps to sophisticated, cloud-enabled enterprise applications. 
Designed to support the complete web application lifecycle: building, testing, deploying, managing, and updating.
Includes infrastructureâ€”servers, storage, networking, middleware, development tools, business intelligence (BI) services, database management systems, and more.
Removes the need for your organization to manage the underlying infrastructure

*Software as a Service*

Allows users to connect to and use cloud-based apps over the Internet.
Examples are email, calendaring, and office tools.
Provides you with a completed product that is run and managed by the service provider.

*Cloud-based Applications*

fully deployed in the cloud and all parts of the application run in the cloud.

*Hybrid*

Infrastructure and applications between cloud-based resources and existing resources that are not located in the cloud.

*On-premises*

Resources on-premises, using virtualization and resource management tools
Often called private cloud

*AWS Console*

Provides several ways for you to locate and navigate among the services you need.
Gives you secure login using your AWS or IAM account credentials.
